### Hi there ! I am Srinitya Reddy ; )

I am a highly motivated and ambitious Computer Science Master's student, with a strong academic record and a clear vision for my future. I thrive on challenges and always tend to learn new stuff. I’m organized, committed, particular, and persistent. And I’m also a good communicator which helps me work with people. I love learning new languages and diving deep into them. I am also very organized, motivated, and always willing to do more than is expected of me. Also, I’m an artist, I like to sketch and paint.
